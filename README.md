# To-do List - My 1st React Project

I built this project so I could practice what I have learned during the React - The Complete Guide course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller (available on Udemy).

It's a simple to-do list where you can register activities you need to do and delete it after you've done it. Each new task is pushed to a Realtime Database provided by Firestore, and we retrieve the task list from it too.
